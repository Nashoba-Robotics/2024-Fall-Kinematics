/*
 * The purpose of this command is to test Extend PID values and run it on the robot
 * This should:
 *  - Allow you to input where you want the arm to extend to (either in meters or rotations, both are fine for now)
 *  - Display the position of the arm in the same units
 * 
 * For extra credit, you can restructure some of the code to let you change the PID values in this command
 *  Otherwise, just change values, redeploy, and run.
